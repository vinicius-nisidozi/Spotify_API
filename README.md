# Spotify API
Prerequisites:
1. Login or create a Spotify account
2. Create an app in [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
3. Get API authorization
4. Setup your environment to make Spotify API requests

This is a Data Engineering project developed to exercise API requests and build data pipelines.

In this project I used the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
to built a pipeline to collect artists data that can be used for trending analysis.

Libiries:
```
1. dotenv
2. requests
3. os
4. base64
5. json
```

Key Concepts:
1. API Rest
2. API Authorization
3. Data request

Please check the Demo in ```top_tracks.ipynb``` file.
