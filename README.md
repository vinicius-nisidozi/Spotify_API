# Spotify_API
This is a Data Engineering project developed to exercise API requests and build data pipelines.

In this project I used the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
to built a pipeline to collect artists data that can be used for trending analysis.

Libiries
```
1. dotenv
2. requests
3. os
4. base64
5. json
```

Key Concepts:
1. API Rest
2. API Authorization
3. Data request

Please check the Demo in ```top_tracks.ipynb``` file.
